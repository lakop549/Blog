          <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
          <p>
            Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          <h3>CSS3 Markup</h3>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
            the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
            HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
            alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
            production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web
            design include web graphic design; user interface design; authoring,
            including standardised code and proprietary software; user
            experience design; and search engine optimization.

          <h3>Web security</h3>
          <p>
            Web security is a broad category of security solutions that protect
            your users, devices, and wider network against internet-based
            cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to breaches
            and data loss.

          <h3>Server security</h3>
          <p>
            Server security is a set of measures that protect a server from all
            types of threats, such as DDoS attacks, brute force attacks, and
            careless or malicious users. The measures can include installing and
            maintaining firewalls, enforcing strong passwords and user
            authentication protocols, installing antivirus software, and
            conducting regular backups to avoid data loss.

          <h3>Network security</h3>
          <p>
            Network Security protects your network and data from breaches,
            intrusions and other threats. This is a vast and overarching term
            that describes hardware and software solutions as well as processes
            or rules and configurations relating to network use, accessibility,
            and overall threat protection.
